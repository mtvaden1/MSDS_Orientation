## Binomial Distribution converges to Normal Distribution

In the Histograms Converge notebook file, I demonstrate that the binomial distribution converges to the normal distribution with increasing n value. I show this by creating a series of binomial distributions with increasing n trials (in range 1 to 10000). These distributions have a p-value of .5 in order to have no skew, and are graphed alongside the density curve for a uniform normal distribution. As the value of n trials grows, we can see that the shape of the binomial distribution gets closer with each iteration to the shape of the normal distribution.

Finally, we also graph a normal distribution using the same mean and standard deviation of the largest binomial distribution displayed above, also alongside the line that represents the uniform normal distribution. As we can see, the normal distribution and binomial distribution are almost identical, which shows that the distributions converge with a larger value of n. This agrees with the [Central Limit Theorem](https://digitalfirst.bfwpub.com/stats_applet/stats_applet_2_cltbinom.html#:~:text=The%20Central%20Limit%20Theorem%20says,probability%20of%20the%20same%20event.), which states that binomial distributions get closer to normal distributions with growing n values.
